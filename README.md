# Netflix_Movie_and_WebSeries_dataset_analysis
Analyzing a dataset related to Netflix movies and web series can provide insights into various aspects such as genres, release years, durations, ratings, and more. Below, I'll outline a general approach to perform such an analysis using Python and popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Please note that you would need a dataset to perform this analysis. If you don't have one, you can search for publicly available datasets or scrape data from reliable sources.

# Get the number of null values in each column.

# Percentage of total null values in dataset.
 DataFrame, and then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage of null values in each column. The resulting null_percentages Series will show the percentage of null values for each column in your dataset.

# Checking gender imbalance.
To check gender imbalance using Python, you'll need to have access to relevant data, which can be in the form of a CSV file, Excel spreadsheet, or any other structured data source. You can then use Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization. Here's a simple example using a hypothetical CSV file.

# Get the number of movies and TV shows.
To check the gender imbalance in movies and TV shows using Python, you might need to access a dataset or API that provides information about these media items along with details about the gender of the cast and crew. One popular dataset for this purpose is the IMDb dataset, which contains information about movies and TV shows, including cast and crew details.

# Top Rating.
 top-rated movies or TV shows, you can modify the previous example to retrieve the top-rated items. IMDbPY provides information about ratings for movies and TV shows. Here's an example to get the top-rated movies and TV shows.

 # Analysis of Directors

Next we try to look into the director field which is compound field which needs to be exploded
1. Finding the top 10 directors who produced more movies/tv shows
2. Finding the range of rating categories produced by those directors.

3. 
# Analysis on year and rating of movies and shows

1. Comparison between time chart of movie/shows released year and added into netflix
2. Finding the No. of movies/shows ratings by year added into netflix.

3. ## 4.WHICH GENRES MOVIES WERE RELEASED MOSTLY IN NETFLIX PLATFORM?

4. # Analyze Released and Added Movies and Tv Shows yearwise.

5. # # added Movies and Tv shows yearwise.
The above chart gives an overview of how movies/shows when they are added into netflix.
We can see that 

**netflix started to add more movies/shows only after 2011**
6. # released Movies and Tv shows yearwise.
7.

# Analysis of Movies.
Creating a movie analysis project focused on Netflix involves more complexity, as you'll likely need access to a dataset that includes information about movies available on Netflix. Unfortunately, as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Netflix does not officially release a public API for accessing its content. However, you can find datasets from third-party sources that compile information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

# Analysis of TV shows netflix
Analyzing TV shows on Netflix involves considering various aspects such as popularity, critical acclaim, audience reception, themes, genres, and overall impact. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have real-time data on specific shows, so I'll provide a general analysis based on trends up to that point. Keep in mind that the landscape may have changed since then.

#  DATA EXACTRATIONS FOR MOVIES
Extracting data for movies typically involves accessing databases, APIs, or web scraping. Below are some general methods for extracting movie data.

# WHICH MOVIES IN NETFLIX HAS MORE DURATION OF TIMES IN MINUTES?

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have real-time information, including the current catalog and durations of movies on Netflix. The availability of movies on Netflix can vary by region and change over time due to licensing agreements.
